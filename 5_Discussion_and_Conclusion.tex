\label{chap:discussion_and_conclusion}
In this chapter, we summarize the key findings of our research, discuss their implications, and outline potential future work. Our study has demonstrated the effectiveness of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in various applications, particularly in the context of autonomous systems and robotics.
We have shown that SNNs can be effectively utilized for tasks such as Autonomous Target Detection (ATD) and consensus flying, leveraging their ability to process temporal information and adapt to dynamic environments.
Furthermore, we have explored the integration of SNNs with Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) for docking applications, highlighting the advantages of using event-based sensors in robotic systems.
The results of our experiments indicate that SNNs can achieve high accuracy and efficiency in these tasks.
\section{Future Work}

Looking ahead, there are several avenues for future research. One potential direction is to further enhance the learning algorithms used in SNNs, particularly in the context of online learning and adaptation to new environments.
